Author: Lauren Emily Coats
## Overview
This project is an in-depth analyzation of top 150 movies, based on ROI from the past 10 years. Concluding in three Professional recommendations for Microsoft that will aid them in making profitable business decisions regarding the creation of original video content.
## Business Problem
This project was challenged with the task to come up with three actionable items that will just start the creation os video content for Microsoft that will position them to becoming market leaders at the box office. 
## Data
This project uses dated scraped from Imdb. Only the data from the last 10 years what used and the top 150 movies based on their domestic ROI where used to come up with the actionable item.  Occasionally all the data for the past ten years was used to show how strong certain relationships where.  Extreme outliers were removed to interpret data that was reflective of the market. 
## Methods 
This information was cleaned and then used to come up with graphs, charts, insights relevant to solving the business problem.
## Results 
## Conclusions
Based on the results the following three conclusions where made. <br />
          •	The movie length should be 102 minutes.  Movies both above and below that threshold saw low ROI.  Having a move with length 102 removes run time of being a cause of low ROI. <br />
          •	The budget for the first movie should be $126,910,716.  Since it is expected that Microsoft is aiming to be a market leader they should expect to budget similar to the current market leaders. <br />
          •	Making a worldwide movie is a must.  Once a movie is made is simple to make copies and pass them along, especially to other English-speaking countries. 
## Next Steps 
Given more time and resources the following would be useful in drilling further down on profitable recommendation for this new venture: <br />
          •	Scape and use various movie websites and compare information.<br />
          •	Sign up for a benchmark to get data directly from other studios. Scraping website is ok but sometimes the information is not always reliable which is investing in a benchmark would protect Microsoft from making decisions based off unreliable data. <br />
          •	Research changes to the movie industry since as a result of COVID. ie When will movies attendance be back to normal? How has movies going straight to digital effected the marker?<br />
          •	Investigate weather how many non-domestic movies where not translate and see how that effect ROI. Since taking a move worldwide doubles the ROI it worth using resources to investigate what moves do well over seas and what movies do not. <br />
          •	Explore what makes extremely profitable movies so successful.
